              In Madagascar, child mortality is high and many die from diseases
              that can be easily treated with modern medicine. Typical causes
              are infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrheal
              diseases and malaria. The country also has one of the highest
              incidences of plague in the world, as well as epidemics and
              pandemics that have otherwise been fought in other countries. Many
              have a long way to the nearest clinic and/or hospital, and the
              costs are high. They therefore do not seek help until it is too
              late. Many of the children we meet on the streets often have major
              health challenges, and several suffer from severe malnutrition.

              Schooling gives children hope for the future. When children lack
              basic knowledge and skills, they have limited opportunities.
              Education helps break the cycle of poverty and is a vital tool in
              combating poverty. The main goal of MMF is for children to become
              independent adults with their own income in the future. Therefore,
              it is important to facilitate the success and well-being of
              children in school. Public schooling in Madagascar is free, but
              the cost of uniforms, textbooks, stationery, and notebooks is
              often too high for families. As a result, children are sent out to
              beg or work to support their families. The children we encounter
              on the streets have either dropped out of primary school or never
              had the opportunity to attend school, and they cannot read or
              write. To succeed in getting these children back to school, we
              have found it important to prepare them well. We have established
              a pre-school program where children practice reading and writing,
              and learn mathematics, Malagasy, and French before starting
              school. All children in MMF are now attending school or receiving
              other forms of education. We have a future plan for each child
              based on their interests. Together, we will help and support them
              towards their goals. Public schooling in Madagascar is half a day
              (about 4 hours), and the children come to MMF every day after
              school to practice instruments and do homework. As many parents
              cannot read or write themselves, we have introduced homework
              assistance so that children have a chance to succeed in school. We
              are experiencing good results with this, and several children have
              excelled in school. In addition to schooling and education,
              children also receive English lessons from us. We know that this
              can potentially help children secure a job in the future. Few
              Malagasy people speak English, so it is a great advantage for
              children to learn English. They can then have job opportunities
              such as being a guide, interpreter, or English teacher.
              Additionally, it is easier for children to communicate with
              visitors and volunteers at MMF. Some students need alternative
              solutions for education for various reasons, and we have some
              older students who attend vocational training instead of regular
              school. We are proud that last year we had a student who obtained
              a tailoring certificate. She now sews school uniforms for the
              other students among other things.

              Many of the children we enroll as students in MMF live on the
              streets when we first meet them. The reason they live on the
              streets is poverty. These children are left to fend for
              themselves, and older children often take on the responsibility of
              caring for younger siblings. Life on the streets is extremely
              tough, and every day is a struggle for survival. During the day,
              children spend a lot of energy begging for money and searching for
              food. As night falls, it's important to find a safe place to sleep
              for the night. Nights can be cold and dangerous, and the children
              huddle together to keep warm.

              Despite Madagascar being known for its lush climate, the country
              has been affected by natural disasters and the worst drought in
              decades, attributed to climate change. This has resulted in crop
              failure, leading to food crises and famine. Parents struggle to
              provide enough food and clean water for their children. When
              families cannot feed their children, sending them out to beg
              becomes the only option for survival. Children living on the
              streets spend a lot of time and energy searching for food scraps
              and often have to resort to scavenging through others' garbage.

              Meeting basic needs is crucial, but we also recognize that
              children need more. They need motivation, inspiration, joy,
              something to aspire to, new thoughts, and a belief that something
              else is possible. This brings us to the essence of the project:
              music. Studies show that when listening to and learning new music,
              new brain cells and connections are created. Research also shows
              that music enhances memory. Parents in MMF observe that their
              children perform better in school after they start playing an
              instrument. Collaboration is also particularly valuable, teaching
              children to cooperate, listen to each other, and express
              themselves. For us at MMF, quality and professionalism are
              important. We collaborate with professional musicians who elevate
              us and take us to a new level. For some children, the instrument
              becomes the direction in life, bringing forth enthusiasm and joy.
              Some aspire to become professional musicians and pursue music as a
              career. Madagascar is a country with a rich musical culture.
              Perhaps that's why music resonates so well here. Many children
              have rhythm in their bodies and start dancing as soon as they can
              stand. Harmonious singing is part of daily life, and we see that
              children learn quickly. Even though not all children in MMF aim to
              become professional musicians, music is beneficial for the
              development of all children. Instruments MMF started with violins.
              Over time, the music school has evolved to include more
              instruments in addition to Malagasy folk music, dance, and
              singing. Currently, students have the opportunity to learn the
              following instruments at MMF: Violin, viola, cello, double bass,
              recorder, guitar, piano, flute, and clarinet. Additionally, we
              have dance groups, choirs, and percussion groups.

              One of our goals is to make MMF larger and more well-known so that
              we can include more children living tough lives on the streets.
              The main goal is for all children in Antsirabe to have enough
              food, clothing, experience care, have a safe and good home, attend
              school, and have the opportunity to develop their talents. It is
              important for us that the assistance we provide contributes to
              independence. The goal is for children to attend school and
              develop their talents so that one day they will become assets in
              their own communities, find employment, and stand on their own
              feet. Dream of our own building We are fortunate to have acquired
              a large plot of land with great potential. Here, we dream of
              building our own music school with excellent practice rooms, a
              kitchen and dining hall, a small stage where we can hold concerts
              for visitors, and a small sewing room with an associated shop.
              Here, we will also be able to grow our own food used in lunch for
              the children in the music school. We also want the outdoor areas
              to be a good place for the children to play between rehearsals and
              homework. Goals for music education The students practice
              diligently, and our orchestra is starting to become sought after
              locally. We already receive performance requests from both the
              municipality and private individuals. Throughout 2024, we envision
              focusing even more on performances, now also with smaller
              ensembles and groups. Performing for others motivates the children
              to practice, fosters cohesion within the group, and provides
              valuable work experience for those children who want to pursue
              music. It also spreads joy in the community. We hope to eventually
              expand our string orchestra into a youth symphony orchestra. Some
              students excel on their instruments, and we want to provide them
              with the training they need to later become instrumental teachers
              either at MMF or elsewhere. Our goal is for suitable students to
              become future teachers. This will provide them with a secure
              income and make them sought after in the job market. We aim to
              perform concerts in several places in Madagascar and annually go
              on a longer trip with the students. It is wonderful and important
              for the students to get to know their own country and history,
              while also sharing our joy of music with other communities.
              Madagascar is an island, but most of our students have never seen
              the sea! We also dream of bringing a group of students to Norway
              for cultural exchange and further musical development.

              Children growing up in poverty in Antsirabe often have significant
              responsibilities from a very young age. They take care of younger
              siblings, cook meals, and are tasked with earning money for the
              family through begging. Sometimes, children are also assigned
              physically demanding tasks such as carrying sacks of rice or
              pushing heavy water cans, receiving little to no pay for their
              work. Entrusting adults with the responsibility of caring for
              their own children is an important part of our work. Children
              should get to be children! Therefore, play is an essential part of
              everyday life at MMF. Many of the children have previously been
              part of a gang of street children where begging was the norm, and
              activities on the fringes of the law, such as petty theft, were
              common. To prevent the students from "falling back" into their
              former environments, it is crucial for them to make new good
              friends and have a timetable filled with enjoyable and meaningful
              activities. Birthday Celebrations At the end of each month, we
              celebrate all children and staff who have birthdays in that month.
              We have lunch together as a group, and a big birthday cake is
              served for everyone to enjoy a slice. This is an important day for
              the children who are not accustomed to celebrating their
              birthdays. Sewing Classes and Cooking For some of the older
              students, vocational training may be the right path. We have
              students attending tailoring classes and baking courses. The
              education is funded by MMF. The tailoring course lasts for two
              years, and upon passing the final exam, students receive a
              publicly recognized certificate as a tailor. This provides young
              people with excellent opportunities in the job market in the
              future. Picnics Occasionally, we go to a nearby park and have a
              picnic with the students. There is also plenty of space for ball
              games and play. These trips are essential for fostering group
              cohesion and making the children a close-knit group. At the same
              time, these outings provide a much-needed break from everyday
              life.
