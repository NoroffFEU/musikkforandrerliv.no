                In Madagascar, child mortality is high and many die from
                diseases that can be easily treated with modern medicine.
                Typical causes are infectious diseases such as pneumonia,
                tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases and malaria. The country also
                has one of the highest incidences of plague in the world, as
                well as epidemics and pandemics that have otherwise been fought
                in other countries. Many have a long way to the nearest clinic
                and/or hospital, and the costs are high. They therefore do not
                seek help until it is too late. Many of the children we meet on
                the streets often have major health challenges, and several
                suffer from severe malnutrition.

                Schooling gives children hope for the future. When children lack
                basic knowledge and skills, they have limited opportunities.
                Education helps break the cycle of poverty and is a vital tool
                in combating poverty. The main goal of MMF is for children to
                become independent adults with their own income in the future.
                Therefore, it is important to facilitate the success and
                well-being of children in school. Public schooling in Madagascar
                is free, but the cost of uniforms, textbooks, stationery, and
                notebooks is often too high for families. As a result, children
                are sent out to beg or work to support their families. The
                children we encounter on the streets have either dropped out of
                primary school or never had the opportunity to attend school,
                and they cannot read or write. To succeed in getting these
                children back to school, we have found it important to prepare
                them well. We have established a pre-school program where
                children practice reading and writing, and learn mathematics,
                Malagasy, and French before starting school. All children in MMF
                are now attending school or receiving other forms of education.
                We have a future plan for each child based on their interests.
                Together, we will help and support them towards their goals.
                Public schooling in Madagascar is half a day (about 4 hours),
                and the children come to MMF every day after school to practice
                instruments and do homework. As many parents cannot read or
                write themselves, we have introduced homework assistance so that
                children have a chance to succeed in school. We are experiencing
                good results with this, and several children have excelled in
                school. In addition to schooling and education, children also
                receive English lessons from us. We know that this can
                potentially help children secure a job in the future. Few
                Malagasy people speak English, so it is a great advantage for
                children to learn English. They can then have job opportunities
                such as being a guide, interpreter, or English teacher.
                Additionally, it is easier for children to communicate with
                visitors and volunteers at MMF. Some students need alternative
                solutions for education for various reasons, and we have some
                older students who attend vocational training instead of regular
                school. We are proud that last year we had a student who
                obtained a tailoring certificate. She now sews school uniforms
                for the other students among other things.

                Many of the children we enroll as students in MMF live on the
                streets when we first meet them. The reason they live on the
                streets is poverty. These children are left to fend for
                themselves, and older children often take on the responsibility
                of caring for younger siblings. Life on the streets is extremely
                tough, and every day is a struggle for survival. During the day,
                children spend a lot of energy begging for money and searching
                for food. As night falls, it's important to find a safe place to
                sleep for the night. Nights can be cold and dangerous, and the
                children huddle together to keep warm.

                Despite Madagascar being known for its lush climate, the country
                has been affected by natural disasters and the worst drought in
                decades, attributed to climate change. This has resulted in crop
                failure, leading to food crises and famine. Parents struggle to
                provide enough food and clean water for their children. When
                families cannot feed their children, sending them out to beg
                becomes the only option for survival. Children living on the
                streets spend a lot of time and energy searching for food scraps
                and often have to resort to scavenging through others' garbage.

                Meeting basic needs is crucial, but we also recognize that
                children need more. They need motivation, inspiration, joy,
                something to aspire to, new thoughts, and a belief that
                something else is possible. This brings us to the essence of the
                project: music. Studies show that when listening to and learning
                new music, new brain cells and connections are created. Research
                also shows that music enhances memory. Parents in MMF observe
                that their children perform better in school after they start
                playing an instrument. Collaboration is also particularly
                valuable, teaching children to cooperate, listen to each other,
                and express themselves. For us at MMF, quality and
                professionalism are important. We collaborate with professional
                musicians who elevate us and take us to a new level. For some
                children, the instrument becomes the direction in life, bringing
                forth enthusiasm and joy. Some aspire to become professional
                musicians and pursue music as a career. Madagascar is a country
                with a rich musical culture. Perhaps that's why music resonates
                so well here. Many children have rhythm in their bodies and
                start dancing as soon as they can stand. Harmonious singing is
                part of daily life, and we see that children learn quickly. Even
                though not all children in MMF aim to become professional
                musicians, music is beneficial for the development of all
                children. Instruments MMF started with violins. Over time, the
                music school has evolved to include more instruments in addition
                to Malagasy folk music, dance, and singing. Currently, students
                have the opportunity to learn the following instruments at MMF:
                Violin, viola, cello, double bass, recorder, guitar, piano,
                flute, and clarinet. Additionally, we have dance groups, choirs,
                and percussion groups.

                One of our goals is to make MMF larger and more well-known so
                that we can include more children living tough lives on the
                streets. The main goal is for all children in Antsirabe to have
                enough food, clothing, experience care, have a safe and good
                home, attend school, and have the opportunity to develop their
                talents. It is important for us that the assistance we provide
                contributes to independence. The goal is for children to attend
                school and develop their talents so that one day they will
                become assets in their own communities, find employment, and
                stand on their own feet. Dream of our own building We are
                fortunate to have acquired a large plot of land with great
                potential. Here, we dream of building our own music school with
                excellent practice rooms, a kitchen and dining hall, a small
                stage where we can hold concerts for visitors, and a small
                sewing room with an associated shop. Here, we will also be able
                to grow our own food used in lunch for the children in the music
                school. We also want the outdoor areas to be a good place for
                the children to play between rehearsals and homework. Goals for
                music education The students practice diligently, and our
                orchestra is starting to become sought after locally. We already
                receive performance requests from both the municipality and
                private individuals. Throughout 2024, we envision focusing even
                more on performances, now also with smaller ensembles and
                groups. Performing for others motivates the children to
                practice, fosters cohesion within the group, and provides
                valuable work experience for those children who want to pursue
                music. It also spreads joy in the community. We hope to
                eventually expand our string orchestra into a youth symphony
                orchestra. Some students excel on their instruments, and we want
                to provide them with the training they need to later become
                instrumental teachers either at MMF or elsewhere. Our goal is
                for suitable students to become future teachers. This will
                provide them with a secure income and make them sought after in
                the job market. We aim to perform concerts in several places in
                Madagascar and annually go on a longer trip with the students.
                It is wonderful and important for the students to get to know
                their own country and history, while also sharing our joy of
                music with other communities. Madagascar is an island, but most
                of our students have never seen the sea! We also dream of
                bringing a group of students to Norway for cultural exchange and
                further musical development.

                Children growing up in poverty in Antsirabe often have
                significant responsibilities from a very young age. They take
                care of younger siblings, cook meals, and are tasked with
                earning money for the family through begging. Sometimes,
                children are also assigned physically demanding tasks such as
                carrying sacks of rice or pushing heavy water cans, receiving
                little to no pay for their work. Entrusting adults with the
                responsibility of caring for their own children is an important
                part of our work. Children should get to be children! Therefore,
                play is an essential part of everyday life at MMF. Many of the
                children have previously been part of a gang of street children
                where begging was the norm, and activities on the fringes of the
                law, such as petty theft, were common. To prevent the students
                from "falling back" into their former environments, it is
                crucial for them to make new good friends and have a timetable
                filled with enjoyable and meaningful activities. Birthday
                Celebrations At the end of each month, we celebrate all children
                and staff who have birthdays in that month. We have lunch
                together as a group, and a big birthday cake is served for
                everyone to enjoy a slice. This is an important day for the
                children who are not accustomed to celebrating their birthdays.
                Sewing Classes and Cooking For some of the older students,
                vocational training may be the right path. We have students
                attending tailoring classes and baking courses. The education is
                funded by MMF. The tailoring course lasts for two years, and
                upon passing the final exam, students receive a publicly
                recognized certificate as a tailor. This provides young people
                with excellent opportunities in the job market in the future.
                Picnics Occasionally, we go to a nearby park and have a picnic
                with the students. There is also plenty of space for ball games
                and play. These trips are essential for fostering group cohesion
                and making the children a close-knit group. At the same time,
                these outings provide a much-needed break from everyday life.
