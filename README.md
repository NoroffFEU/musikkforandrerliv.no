# Tailwind:
Tailwind is already configured for this project.

## Tailwind guide
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes in your HTML to style your components

- If you are writing code and want it to update in the live server, remember to run the following code in terminal: **npm run dev**

- If you are not gonna code, but just want to see how the project looks, run this code in the terminal: **npm run build** 

- plugins you can use to help with tailwind: **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense & Tailwind Docs**

- If the Tailwind code is not working, and you have tried the above, you can also look in the **Problems** tab and see if there are any issues there.
