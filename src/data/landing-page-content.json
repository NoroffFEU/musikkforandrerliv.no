    "content": "MMF was officially founded in Antsirabe, Madagascar, in 2021 by Eline Rodvelt Hansen and her husband Dina Rasalina Andriamanalina. The history of MMF dates back to 2018 when Eline packed two violins and traveled expectantly to Madagascar. While studying the violin at the Grieg Academy in Bergen, she had a strong desire to teach children who otherwise would not have the opportunity to develop their talents. Her dream eventually became to start a music school for the poorest children in Madagascar."

Typical causes are infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases and malaria. The country also has one of the highest incidences of plague in the world, as well as epidemics and pandemics that have otherwise been fought in other countries. Many have a long way to the nearest clinic and/or hospital, and the costs are high. They therefore do not seek help until it is too late. Many of the children we meet on the streets often have major health challenges, and several suffer from severe malnutrition."
