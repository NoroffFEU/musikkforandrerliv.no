Besides private donors, our biggest supporter is Musikk Gir Liv (musicians from the Kristiansand Orchestra), providing funding for the music school's operation and sound equipment. In the last two years, Musikk Gir Liv visited Antsirabe with a group of musicians from the orchestra, teaching music to MMF children and participating in performances alongside the students."

      "description": "MMF was officially founded in Antsirabe, Madagascar, in 2021 by Eline Rodvelt Hansen and her husband Dina Rasalina Andriamanalina. The MMF story began in 2018 when Eline brought two fiddles to Madagascar with passion and hope. While studying fiddle at the Grieg Academy in Bergen, she dreamed of teaching children who lacked opportunities to develop their talents. Her dream became to establish a music school for the poorest children in Madagascar.",

          "description": "Music lessons are so much more than just learning how to play an instrument. To our students the music school has become a place of safety, worthiness, and a notion of being cared for by the teachers and other students.\nThe transforming power of education and the strong communal sense have brought so many young children from the streets where they were involved in begging and violence – into classrooms with a safe and stimulating environment that nurtures their sense of purpose, self-worth and ability to change their lives for the better through learning."

          "title": "Empowering Through Education",
          "description": "Many of our students have never had the opportunity to go to school previously. Therefore, the teachers of MMF have organized some additional support for children who struggle with their homework – the initiative that has proven to have a great impact on the development, learning capacity and safety of the children.\nAs a result of the after-school academic support, children who previously could not read or write are now proving successful academic and social development.\nWith a special emphasis on female education and gender equality we strive to empower the girls through music and general education to have an increased control over their lives though making better informed decisions."

          "title": "Sustainable Growth and Community impact",
          "description": "Providing a safe, caring and supportive environment we see how the girls and young women further inspire their parents to live healthier, more stable lives. As such, we witness an intergenerational transformation that education has a power to set in motion– and that inspires us to continue to work with dedication, passion and commitment.\nSince 2021 Mozika Manova Fiainana registered as an NGO and has an independent board of directors, supporting over 60 children. As we are expanding our teaching capacities, we are happy to be working with the local music teachers and creating new local jobs."

      "description": "In Madagascar, child mortality is high, and many children die from diseases that could be easily treated with modern medicine. Common causes include infectious diseases such as respiratory infections, fever, gastrointestinal illnesses, and malaria. Madagascar also has one of the highest rates of malaria in the world, alongside other epidemics and pandemics that have been eradicated in other countries. Many people must travel long distances to reach the nearest clinic or hospital, and medical costs are expensive. As a result, they often delay seeking help until it is too late. Many of the children we meet on the streets suffer from serious health problems, and a large number of them endure severe malnutrition.",

Typical causes are infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases and malaria. The country also has one of the highest incidences of plague in the world, as well as epidemics and pandemics that have otherwise been fought in other countries. Many have a long way to the nearest clinic and/or hospital, and the costs are high. They therefore do not seek help until it is too late.

Education helps break the cycle of poverty and is a vital tool in combating poverty. The main goal of MMF is for children to become independent adults with their own income in the future. Therefore, it is important to facilitate the success and well-being of children in school."

          "title": "Living Situation",
          "description": "Many of the children we enroll as students in MMF live on the streets when we first meet them. The reason they live on the streets is poverty. These children are left to fend for themselves, and older children often take on the responsibility of caring for younger siblings. Life on the streets is extremely tough, and every day is a struggle for survival. During the day, children spend a lot of energy begging for money and searching for food. As night falls, it's important to find a safe place to sleep for the night. Nights can be cold and dangerous, and the children huddle together to keep warm."

          "title": "Food Distribution",
          "description": "Despite Madagascar being known for its lush climate, the country has been affected by natural disasters and the worst drought in decades, attributed to climate change. This has resulted in crop failure, leading to food crises and famine. Parents struggle to provide enough food and clean water for their children. When families cannot feed their children, sending them out to beg becomes the only option for survival. Children living on the streets spend a lot of time and energy searching for food scraps and often have to resort to scavenging through others' garbage."

          "title": "Music Lessons",
          "description": "Meeting basic needs is crucial, but we also recognize that children need more. They need motivation, inspiration, joy, something to aspire to, new thoughts, and a belief that something else is possible. This brings us to the essence of the project: music. Studies show that when listening to and learning new music, new brain cells and connections are created. Research also shows that music enhances memory. Parents in MMF observe that their children perform better in school after they start playing an instrument. Collaboration is also particularly valuable, teaching children to cooperate, listen to each other, and express themselves."

        {
          "title": "Future Goals",
          "description": "One of our goals is to make MMF larger and more well-known so that we can include more children living tough lives on the streets. The main goal is for all children in Antsirabe to have enough food, clothing, experience care, have a safe and good home, attend school, and have the opportunity to develop their talents. It is important for us that the assistance we provide contributes to independence. The goal is for children to attend school and develop their talents so that one day they will become assets in their own communities, find employment, and stand on their own feet."

        {
          "title": "Activities",
          "description": "Children growing up in poverty in Antsirabe often have significant responsibilities from a very young age. They take care of younger siblings, cook meals, and are tasked with earning money for the family through begging. Sometimes, children are also assigned physically demanding tasks such as carrying sacks of rice or pushing heavy water cans, receiving little to no pay for their work. Entrusting adults with the responsibility of caring for their own children is an important part of our work. Children should get to be children! Therefore, play is an essential part of everyday life at MMF."
